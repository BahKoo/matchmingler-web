      <p>
        My name is Pierre (Pete) Gagné. In conjunction with my wife Gisèle
        we have run a number of Singles Mingle events since August of 2024.
        We are happy that we now have a web site which will facilitate
        sharing of information regarding all upcoming events (Singles Mingle
        and others).
      </p>
      <p>
        Special thanks to our son Paul who developed this web page and will
        continue to work on it as we improve the site and share information.

      <h3>Pierre</h3>
      <p>
        My background is that of a computer analyst/programmer having worked
        my entire career in that industry. I have been an owner of race
        horses for many years. I have always enjoyed running and for quite a
        few years competed in 5K, 10K and half marathon races. Due to all of
        the training required to compete I decided to simply run for fun
        starting at the age of 62. Besides running I enjoy playing and
        teaching pickleball and going for long bike rides.
      </p>

      <h3>Gisèle</h3>
      <p>
        Gisèle was a teacher for her entire adult life (until retirement 12
        years ago) in a French school followed by many years teaching French
        immersion at various schools in the southern part of Winnipeg. She
        was devoted to her profession and enjoyed teaching the younger
        children and working as a teacher-librarian.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gisèle loves her pickleball and continues to play 3 times a week
        despite 2 bad knees and a bad hip. People she has played with and
        against her have commented on her awesome serves.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the next few years Gisèle will be looking into knee and hip
        surgery.
      </p>
      <p>
        She has always enjoyed cooking and I have always enjoyed eating her
        prepared dishes.
      </p>

      <h3>Together</h3>
      <p>
        Gisèle and I married at the young age of 20 and will be celebrating 48
        years of marriage this summer (2025). We first went out in grade 7. We
        have 3 wonderful children – 2 boys and a girl.
