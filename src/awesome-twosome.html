  <h3>What is this all about?</h3>
  <p>
    This is a unique concept where you team up with anyone of any age and
    compete in your combined age group.
  </p>
  <p>
    Add your age and your partner's age to determine your age category. You
    then pick your level (from 2.5 to 4.5). Men's, women's and mixed events
    will be offered.
  </p>

  <h3>This is neat!</h3>
  <p>
    This format would open the door to a number of different pairings. For
    example a parent can team up with a child or a grandmother or
    grandfather can team up with a grandchild.
  </p>
  <p>
    The combinations that would be formed would make the tournament full of
    surprises. Two 40 year olds could end up playing against a team
    consisting of a 60 year old and a 28 year old (both would fall within
    the 75-99 combined age category). There is no advantage to either side
    providing that both teams pick the appropriate skill level category
    (from 2.5 to level 4.5).
  </p>

  <h3>When will this take place?</h3>
  <p>
    There will be multiple tournaments offered in 2025 depending on demand.
    As soon as one category has 8 teams it's a GO and a date will be
    chosen.
  </p>
  <p>
    The plan is to have these on weekends to allow everyone a chance to
    participate.
  </p>

  <h3>Cost</h3>
  <p>
    The cost is $60 per team - payable only when a date has been chosen and
    providing the date chosen is acceptable to you.
  </p>
