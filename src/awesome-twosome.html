  <h3>What is this all about?</h3>
  <p>
    Add your age and your partner's age and if the sum falls into the combined age
    category specified for the event you can participate.
  </p>
  <p>
    For example, if the event is for a 75-99 age category two 40-year-olds can
    team up. Also, a 67 year old parent can team up with a 31 year old child.
    How about a grandparent with a grandchild? No problem, as long as the combined
    ages do not exceed 99 (in a 75-99 age event). This makes it interesting and
    allows for younger players to participate in a tournament.
