  <h3>What is Classic Bracket?</h3>
  <p>
    Classic Bracket is a traditional tournament similar to other
    tournaments you may have participated in previously.
  </p>
  <p>Tournaments normally have the following characteristics:</p>
  <h5>Gender</h5>
  <p>
    Sometimes there are categories available for men, other times women.
    There are also mixed categories.
  </p>
  <h5>Levels</h5>
  <p>
    Levels are used to identify a skill level, normally ranging from 2.0 to
    5.0. These levels are actually called DUPR ratings. After having played
    in a tournament at a 3.0 level or 3.5 level for example you will quickly
    learn if that level of play was too easy or too difficult for you and
    your partner. In a subsequent tournament you might move up (if the level
    you chose was too easy) or move down.
  </p>
  <h5>Age</h5>
  <p>
    Sometimes an event may give you an option to select an age category. For
    example there could be an over 50 category that you can choose where
    both partners need to be over the age of 50. There may be a 65+
    category. The purpose of an age category is to allow the older folks to
    play amongst themselves and not have to compete against those quick
    youngsters!
  </p>
  <h5>Number of teams competing in an event</h5>
  <hgroup>
    <p>12 teams (2 pools of 6 teams per pool)</p>
    <p style="padding-left: 15px;">- OR -</p>
    <p>16 teams (2 pools of 8 teams per pool)</p>
  </hgroup>
  <h5>Format</h5>
  <p>
    Round robin - Every team plays every other team in their pool. In addition
    each team is guaranteed 1 playoff game.
  </p>
  <p>
    The top teams from round robin play in the championship round while the other
    teams compete in the consolations.
  </p>
  <h5>Cost</h5>
  <p>The cost will be between $22 and $30 per person depending on the event and includes snacks.</p>
