  <h3>What is the purpose of a Singles Mingle event?</h3>
  <p>
    The purpose of an event is to create a scenario where single people can
    make new acquaintances in a fun environment when playing pickleball.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is not unusual for people to form relationships that lead to dating.
    For that reason there are age categories put in place. For example, it
    would not be great if a 32 year old was the only person under the age of
    50. The events currently being offered are for single people aged 50 and
    up.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the future we could have an event for those under the age of 50 if we
    get enough interest. We can also have an event for those aged 40 to 55
    or 50 to 65 - whatever the demand is.
  </p>

  <h3>
    What if someone is interested in meeting others but has never played
    pickleball?
  </h3>
  <p>
    This is not an issue. For anyone wishing to participate there is free
    training. Typically a person is ready to participate after a 2 hour
    training session.
  </p>

  <h3>
    What if others have been playing a long time and are skilled players?
  </h3>
  <p>
    Again, this is not an issue. Correspondence is sent to all participants
    prior to an event and people are reminded that there are some newbies
    that will be participating. Participants are reminded that this is not
    about winning and more about getting to know other singles. Everyone is
    urged not to spike the ball.
  </p>

  <h3>How many people can participate in an event?</h3>
  <p>
    There are 16 men and 16 women that can participate. Since we play at a
    venue that has 4 courts, 16 people play at a time (8 men and 8 women)
    while the other 16 await their turn. When people are not playing they
    mingle.
  </p>

  <h3>When are these held and what is the format?</h3>
  <p>
    So far these events have been held on Saturdays to cater to those that
    cannot participate during the week due to work commitments. Holding one
    during the week from time to time would be fine providing there was
    enough interest.
  </p>
  <p>
    A Singles Mingle event can last anywhere from 3 to 5 hours.
  </p>
  <p>
    A schedule is created ahead of time and posted for everyone to follow.
    For each game a man and a woman are teamed up to play against another
    couple. Your partner will change from game to game to ensure that you
    meet as many people as possible throughout the event.
  </p>
  <p>
    Time permitting speed dating could be offered at an event.
  </p>

  <h3>What is the cost?</h3>
  <p>
    The price for such events is kept reasonable at $25. This includes
    snacks.
  </p>

  <h3>How successful have these events been?</h3>
  <p>
    There have been many positive comments from those who participated since
    the inaugural event in August 2024.
  </p>
  <p>
    There have been a number of new acquaintances made and friendships
    established. Some have dated as a result of getting to know each other
    through Singles Mingle.
  </p>
  <p>
    Contributing to the success is the input that has been received. A survey
    is sent out after an event asking participants what they liked and if they
    have recommendations for changes. Many of those recommendations were implemented.        
  </p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>
        “What do you get when you bring a group of 50+ year old singles together to play
        pickleball? Singles Mingle. When I joined the group 5 months ago, I had no idea
        how this group would change my life. Not only have I learned to play pickleball,
        but I've made a lifetime of amazing friends.  We've become a community of like
        minded people who enjoy being active and want to gather socially. Not only do we
        play pickleball, we are expanding to other activities: golfing, biking, hiking,
        playing cards and much more. I cannot thank Pierre and Gisèle enough for creating
        this community for all of us. It's been a game changer.”

        “I discovered Pierre's Singles Mingle group last fall through Facebook. Initially,
        I was hesitant to join, but my love for pickleball encouraged me to reach out, mainly
        to find other singles to play with. I'm so glad I did! Pierre and Gisèle do an
        outstanding job organizing fun and well-run events that bring people together.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since joining, I have made many wonderful friends and become part of a truly special
        community. Thanks to this group, I'm now involved in several social activities beyond
        pickleball, connecting with like-minded, fun, and active people. Pierre also hosts
        tournaments that I'm excited to participate in.
      </p>
      <p>
        Joining this group has positively changed my life, and I'm grateful to Pierre and Gisèle
        for creating such an inclusive and welcoming space where friendships flourish.”
